# In-Context Learning and Prompt Design for Computer-Aided Aerodynamic Engineering Application

## Introduction
Welcome to the GitHub repository for my semester project at EPFL CVLab! Here you can find the code, data, and my report for my semester project.

## Dataset
The datasets we need are available at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xZvFEghGXrVrVN5sSFdSvcCZm_sySjxW/view?usp=sharing. We only need the `mesh` and `restart_csv` folders from this link. Check [UIUC Airfoil Data Site](https://m-selig.ae.illinois.edu/ads.html) to learn more about the datasets.

## Code
The main code for this work is included in the **airfoil_pressure_field.ipynb** file. To run the model, use the **model.ipynb** file (credit to https://yossigandelsman.github.io/visual_prompt/).
